# Audience Need

Prospective students have the following needs when they are looking for enrolling in a University: 
National Rankings in Top 30, Safe Campus, Job Opportunities with high Average Salaries at the location, Reasonable Cost of living and Tuition costs

 
# Audience Want 

Students want a Top University with low tuition and living costs, prospect of higher salaries with good curriculum and healthy student to teacher ratio as well as safe environment to study.          
(Students want all of the needs to be matched, but that is rarely possible because an area with higher salaries would have higher costs of living and so on and so forth.)

 
# Audience Fears 

Unable to get a high paying job or sufficient ROI

Unsafe environment

Unable to get into a top University 

Not enough personal attention fromTeachers

(Link to google slide can also be found at the bottom of the fact sheet.)

# Google Slide
The slide contains published data visualizations of the metric used to advocate facts and comparisons about Santa Clara University MSIS program with other colleges.

I have used three metrics:

1st Metric: Santa Clara University MSIS Ranking, acceptance rate and Student to Teacher ratio 
This metric aims at conveying the program ranking, the average acceptance rate of students who apply for programs at the college and Student to teacher ratio which gives students an insight on whether or not they would be receiving the personal attention they deserve.

2nd Metric: Campus Safety
For Parents and students alike, campus safety is top priority. Students should be able to solely focus on studies and that is only possible in a secure environment. So this metric gives prospective students an insight into the nature of security issues or threats in the College and help them make up their mind whether a particular University would be able to give them that peace of mind or not.

3rd Metric: Average Salaries
Every student wants to enroll in a college which affords them the promise of brighter future through gret jobs. This metric gives student salary comparisons between different locations vis-a-vis national average for MSIS specific job profiles.
