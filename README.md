# Google Slide
The slide contains published data visualizations of the metric used to advocate facts and comparisons about Santa Clara University MSIS program with other colleges.
I have used three metrics:
1st Metric: Santa Clara University MSIS Ranking, acceptance rate and Student to Teacher ratio 
This metric aims at conveying the program ranking, the average acceptance rate of students who apply for programs at the college and Student to teacher ratio which gives students an insight on whether or not they would be receiving the personal attention they deserve.

2nd Metric: Campus Safety
For Parents and students alike, campus safety is top priority. Students should be able to solely focus on studies and that is only possible in a secure environment. So this metric gives prospective students an insight into the nature of security issues or threats in the College and help them make up their mind whether a particular University would be able to give them that peace of mind or not.

3rd Metric: Average Salaries
Every student wants to enroll in a college which affords them the promise of brighter future through gret jobs. This metric gives student salary comparisons between different locations vis-a-vis national average for MSIS specific job profiles.
